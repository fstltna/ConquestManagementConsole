Edit "cmc" and change the settings at the top if your Conquest server is not in /root/conquest.

You will need to run cpan and install these modules:

- UI::Dialog
- Term::ReadKey
- Term::ANSIScreen

You also need to have my Conquest Server Startup Script installed.

Then copy "cmc" into a directory in your path and you should be ok. I suggest that you should just leave it in this directory and add this directory to your PATH variable so you can get updates.
